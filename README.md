# data-scientist-interview
When I wanted to become a backend developer my gorgeous [boyfriend](https://github.com/1995parham) made some practical 
interview with me then created a [repository](https://github.com/4lie/stories) and put the questions and answers there.
Now I want to apply for a data scientist position in which unfortunately he has no experience, so I'm making this 
repository and want to put all my practices here.<br/>

## Logical
1. you have buckets one 5 liters the other 3 liters, measure 4 liters:<br/>
first I make the 3 liters bucket full and then pour it to 5 liters bucket then I make it full again and pour it to the 
   5 liters bucket till it gets full so the amount of water left in the 3 liters bucket is 1 liter then I make the 5 liters
   bucket empty and pour that 1 liter in it then make the 3 liters bucket full again and pour it to the 5 liters bucket 
   which had 1 liter inside, so the result is 4 liters of water in the 5 liters bucket.
   
## ML algorithms
1. Differences between supervised and unsupervised:<br/>
In supervised the data has label<br/><br/>
   
2. How is logistic regression done?<br/><br/>
3. Explain steps in decision tree<br/><br/>
4. How do you build a random forest?<br/><br/>
5. How can you avoid overfitting? lasso regression<br/><br/> 
6. **What are feature selection methods? Wrapper methods: forward selection, backward selection. Filter methods: 
   Chi-Square, ANOVA (learn f-distribution, t-test, p-value, null hypothesis and significance level)**<br/><br/>
7. How do you deal with more than 30% missing value?<br/><br/>
8. Explain dimensionality reduction and its benefits<br/><br/>
9. **How will you calculate eigen values and eigen vectors of a 3 by 3 matrix**<br/><br/>
10. **How to maintain deployed model?**<br/><br/>
11. **What are recommender systems?** collaborative, content-based<br/><br/>
12. It rains on saturday with 0.6 probability and rains on sunday with 0.2 probability what is the probability that it
    rains this weekend?<br/><br/>
13. How can you select k for k-means?<br/><br/>
14. **What is the significance of p-value?**<br/><br/>
15. How can outlier values be treated?<br/><br/>
16. **How can you say that a time series data is stationary?**<br/><br/>
17. How can you calculate accuracy using confusion matrix?<br/><br/>
18. Write the equation and calculate precision and recall rate<br/><br/>
19. If a drawer contains 12 red socks, 16 blue socks, and 20 white socks, how many must you pull out to be sure of 
    having a matching pair?<br/><br/>
20. People who bought this, also bought... recommendations seen on Amazon is a result of which algorithm?<br/><br/>
21. Write a SQL query to list orders with customer information?<br/><br/>
22. You are given a dataset on cancer detection. You've built a classification model and achieved an accuracy of 96%.Why 
    shouldn't you be happy with your model performance? What can you do about it?<br/><br/>
23. **Which of the following ML algorithms can be used for imputing missing values of both categorical and continuous 
    variables? K-means-clustering --> crash, linear regression --> crash, Decision tree --> crash, K-NN works**<br/><br/>
24. calculate entropy [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]<br/><br/>
25.
