# data-scientist-interview
When I wanted to become a backend developer my gorgeous [boyfriend](https://github.com/1995parham) made some practical 
interview with me then created a [repository](https://github.com/4lie/stories) and put the questions and answers there.
Now I want to apply for a data scientist position in which unfortunately he has no experience, so I'm making this 
repository and want to put all my practices here.<br/>

## Logical
1. you have buckets one 5 liters the other 3 liters, measure 4 liters:<br/>
first I make the 3 liters bucket full and then pour it to 5 liters bucket then I make it full again and pour it to the 
   5 liters bucket till it gets full so the amount of water left in the 3 liters bucket is 1 liter then I make the 5 liters
   bucket empty and pour that 1 liter in it then make the 3 liters bucket full again and pour it to the 5 liters bucket 
   which had 1 liter inside, so the result is 4 liters of water in the 5 liters bucket.
   
## ML algorithms
1. Differences between supervised and unsupervised:<br/>
In supervised the data has label<br/><br/>
   
2. How is logistic regression done?<br/><br/>
3. Explain steps in decision tree<br/><br/>
4. How do you build a random forest?<br/><br/>
5. How can you avoid overfitting? lasso regression<br/><br/> 
6. What are feature selection methods? Wrapper methods: forward selection, backward selection. Filter methods: 
   Chi-Square, ANOVA (learn f-distribution and t-test)<br/><br/>
